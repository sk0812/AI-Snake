# AI Snake

This project is an AI-powered version of the classic Snake game, built from scratch using Python and Pygame. The AI is trained using supervised learning with PyTorch to effectively play and beat the game. Additionally, data is collected during training and visualized with Matplotlib.

## Project Overview

1. **Snake Game**: A fully functional version of the Snake game where the player controls a snake that grows in length by consuming food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

2. **AI Training with PyTorch**: The AI agent is trained using supervised learning techniques, allowing it to learn optimal strategies for navigating the game environment based on collected data.

3. **Data Visualization**: Training data, including the snake's performance metrics, is collected and visualized using Matplotlib to analyze the AI's learning progress over time.

## Features

- **Custom Game Mechanics**: Built from scratch, featuring classic Snake gameplay mechanics with options for customization.
- **AI Implementation**: Trained AI using supervised learning to optimize gameplay strategies.
- **Data Collection**: Collects performance data during AI training for analysis.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Utilizes Matplotlib to plot graphs showing the AI's performance metrics, such as score and learning progress.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Pygame**: A library for creating video games, providing functionalities for graphics, sound, and input handling.
- **PyTorch**: A machine learning library used for training the AI agent with supervised learning techniques.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for visualizing performance metrics and data analysis.
